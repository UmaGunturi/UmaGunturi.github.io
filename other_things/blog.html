        <h1>Books I’m Reading</h1>

        <p>
        Inspired by <a href="https://maria-antoniak.github.io/reading" target="_blank">Maria Antoniak’s thoughtful reading list</a>,
        I’ve started tracking some of the books I’ve been reading lately. I’m starting off with a mix of emotionally rich, 
        easy-to-read fiction and experimental short stories — many of which are surreal, poetic, or quietly strange.
      </p>
      <p>
        Some of my favorite formats lately have been short story collections, novellas, and translated works. 
        If you’re also just easing back into reading or looking for literary work that doesn’t require a huge time commitment, 
        I recommend:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><b>The Days at the Morisaki Bookshop</b> by Satoshi Yagisawa</li>
        <li><b>Ikigai: The Japanese Secret to a Long and Happy Life</b> by Héctor García & Francesc Miralles</li>
        <li><b>The Four Agreements</b> by Don Miguel Ruiz</li>
        <li><i>Cat Town</i> by Sakutaro Hagiwara </li>
        <li><b>Wild</b> by Cheryl Strayed</li>
      </ul>
